# 2. On the theory of text

Even the most simple text contains overlapping hierarchies, such that pages start and end out of sync with the start of end with paragraphs, sections and chapters.

## Consequences of overlapping hierarchies:

- Renear et al. (1996) describe various theories of text and how to cope with them.
[effect the modelling](http://cds.library.brown.edu/resources/stg/monographs/ohco.html).
Their contribution was presented at a conference 1993, long before text encoding where done in XML rather than SGML.


- C. M. Sperberg-McQueen and Claus Huitfeldt (2008) works on [Complex
mark-up using their own language TexMECS](http://www.balisage.net/Proceedings/vol1/html/Sperberg-McQueen01/BalisageVol1-Sperberg-McQueen01.html).
There are similar much more extreme mark-up languages. Experiences from the Wittgenstein archive.
