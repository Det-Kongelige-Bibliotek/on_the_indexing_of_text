<a href="06_references.md#renear">Renear et al. (1996)</a> describe well all problems with the modelling of
text. Note that their contribution was presented at a congress 1993,
which means that it appeared long before text encoding where done in
XML rather than SGML or other encoding schemas. Even the most simple
text contains overlapping hierarchies, such that pages start and ends
out of sync with the start of end with paragraphs, sections and
chapters.
