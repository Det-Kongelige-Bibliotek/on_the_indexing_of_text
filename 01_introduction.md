# 1. Introduction

Book worms are interested in books inasmuch as they are carriers of a
text. Book collectors are interested typography and book binding or
book art in a broad sense. In particular if it is valuable.

There are other important distinctions, like the one between searching
for texts and searching in texts. To search for texts implies search
and retrieval of, say, novels, essays or scientific papers, whereas
when searching inside a text you expect to find which paragraphs that
match your criteria.

When searching for texts the queries are fairly specific, like
_motorcycle maintenance_, the _care and handling of blueberry bushes_
or _jam recipes_. Fact is all about subject, the audience is
motorcycle owners and others in need for facts. 

Searching for literary texts is the same, like _give me all novels by
Miguel de Cervantes_ is not different from finding all papers by Linus
Pauling.

The subject of fiction is more difficult, though. Most fiction is about
love, sex, hatred, solitude, illness and death (and other usually
related topics). These subjects are usually covered in detail in
fairly long texts (such as novels) without ever explicitly mentioning
those terms.

The audience is book worms (and other people in search
for love), and dinner speakers who need exact quotations of love
poetry for wedding talks.

## This paper is 

- about the building of a search index for fiction,
- enabling users to search for texts using elementary metadata
- and also inside those texts.

We do not 

- explore fiction subject search,
- care about the physical structure except pagination
