# 1. Introduction

There are some important distinctions one must be aware of, like the
one between searching for texts and searching inside texts. Then, as a
third option, to do both things simultaneously. To search for texts
implies search and retrieval of, say, whole books and papers, whereas
when searching inside a book you expect to find which paragraphs that
match your criteria.

We have other distinctions to make when it comes to searching. Most
searches in a general search engine is about something fairly
specific, like _motorcycle maintenance_, the _care and handling of
blueberry bushes_ or _jam recipes_.

Searching for literary texts is different for they are all about love,
sex, isolation and death (and related topics). These subjects are
usually covered in detail without ever mentioning those terms.
