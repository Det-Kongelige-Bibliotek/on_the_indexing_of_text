# 1. Introduction

There are some important distinctions one must be aware of, like the
one between searching for texts and searching inside texts. To search
for texts implies search and retrieval of, say, whole novels, essays
and scientific papers, whereas when searching inside a text you expect
to find which paragraphs that match your criteria. Users may want to
do both things simultaneously.

We have other distinctions to make when it comes to searching
texts. Most searches in a general search engine is about something
fairly specific, like _motorcycle maintenance_, the _care and handling
of blueberry bushes_ or _jam recipes_. Fact is all about aboutishness,
the audience is motorcycle owners and others in need for facts.

Searching literary texts is different. All fiction is about love,
sex, hatred, solitude, illness and death (and only a few other related
topics). These subjects are usually covered in detail in fairly long
texts (such as novels) without ever explicitly mentioning those
terms. The audience is book worms and other people in search for love,
such as dinner speakers who need exact quotations of love poetry for
their wedding talks.

It is a common misunderstanding that books are important. Bookworms
are only interested in books inasmuch as they are carriers of the
text. Books and pages as such are for people thinking about
paleography, typography and book binding or book art in a broad sense.
